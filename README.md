# Which Diversity

An simple alexa skill written in Python that returns the ethnicity / race and gender of a given name. 

Alexa will expect a name once the nameQuery intent has been triggered, which will then be used to query a public API called diversity data:

[Diversity Data API](https://diversitydata.io/)

This can be useful when trying to understand a persons background given their name. For example, some use cases for this API can be:

 - Diversity & Inclusion
 - Talent Acquisition
 - HR Analytics

I have provided the source code (**lambda_function.py**) and build template (**en-US.json**) in this repository.
